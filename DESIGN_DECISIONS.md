### Decision: Web App Prototype over Native Mobile App

- **What was decided**: To build the initial prototype as a web application using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, rather than a React Native mobile application.
- **Why it was chosen**: The provided starter project is a Next.js application, and the user-provided "App Blueprint" explicitly lists a web tech stack (NextJS, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Genkit). This indicates a more recent and specific requirement compared to the initial prose which mentioned React Native and Firebase. Prototyping as a web app allows for faster development cycles, easier iteration, and leverages the existing project setup. It will be fully responsive to simulate a mobile experience.
- **Alternatives considered**: Sticking to the React Native plan would have required scaffolding a new project and discarding the provided Next.js starter.
